sports_app - Frontend only (Flutter)

This is a minimal Flutter frontend (no backend) that implements a Home screen
for a sports-themed e-commerce UI. The product data is local and images are
loaded from network URLs.

How to run:

1. Install Flutter (if not installed).
2. In a terminal:
   cd sports_app
   flutter pub get
   flutter run -d web-server --web-hostname=0.0.0.0 --web-port=8080

Open the forwarded port shown by your environment (or open the given URL).
